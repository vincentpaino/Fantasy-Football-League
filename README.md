"A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory with its own installation 
of Python and its own libraries. This isolation ensures that the dependencies you install 
for one project don’t interfere with other projects."

"After creating the environment, you’ll need to activate it to use the isolated interpreter and libraries."
Command: venv\Scripts\activate
